# Exploring-COVID-19-Data-Through-Visualizations-with-Matplotlib


The provided code is divided into multiple sections, each aimed at visualizing different aspects of COVID-19 data using matplotlib in Python. Let's break down each section:

Line Plot of Daily Confirmed Cases Over Time:

The code loads COVID-19 data from a CSV file and extracts the required columns for plotting.
It then plots the daily confirmed cases over time using a line plot.
The plot is customized with a black background, blue color for the line, and markers for data points.
Annotations are added to specific data points, and a title is set for the plot.
Annotation for Second Lockdown:

An annotation is added to mark the date of the second lockdown (15th April).
The annotation includes a text label and an arrow pointing to the corresponding data point on the plot.
Pie Chart for Transmission Categories:

Data for transmission categories (Travel, Place Visit, Unknown) and their frequencies are defined.
A pie chart is plotted to visualize the distribution of transmission categories.
The pie chart is customized with colors, explode effect, and shadow.
A title is set for the pie chart.
Bar Plot for District-wise Breakdown:

COVID-19 data for district-wise breakdown (confirmed, recovered, deceased cases) is loaded from another CSV file.
A bar plot is created to show the number of confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases for each district.
The plot is customized with a black background, different colors for each category, and annotations for each bar.
Legend and title are added to the plot for clarity.
Overall, the code aims to visualize COVID-19 data effectively using matplotlib. It covers various aspects such as daily cases over time, transmission categories, and district-wise breakdown of cases. Annotations and customizations are used to enhance the readability and insights from the visualizations.
